• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
In Git, to "fast forward" means to update the HEAD pointer in such a way that its new value is a direct descendant of the prior value.

• Why should you have different branches?
Different branches enable developers to isolate their work and merge them into the main branch when ready. They also help keep the main branch error free and in a working condition at all times.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
There is no limit except there can only be one branch named 'origin' which is the default remote created by Git when you clone an existing repository.
